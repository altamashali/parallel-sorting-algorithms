## 2. _due 11/3_ Project topic 

The topic we have chosen is finding either shortest or simply "short" solutions for arbitrary initial states of Rubik's cube. Our code will take the initial configuration of a Rubik's Cube as input, then run three different algorithms (Thistlethwaite's, Kociemba's, Korf's) in parallel to find the most optimal solution.

## 2. _due 11/3_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For the project, we will be comparing the following three algorithms:
- Thistlethwaite's Algorithm (MPI + CUDA)
...Version:
...Psuedocode/Description:
- Kociemba's Algorithm (MPI + CUDA)
...Version:
...Psuedocode/Description:
- Korf's Algorithm (MPI + CUDA)
...Version:
...Psuedocode/Description:

Communication:
Our team is using a Discord server to communicate. We have a Google Drive for collaborating on the markdown sheet, and are using GitHub to collaborate on the code.  

## 3. _due 11/12_ Pseudocode for each algorithm and implementation

## 3. _due 11/12_ Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare

For example:
- Effective use of a GPU (play with problem size and number of threads)
- Strong scaling to more nodes (same problem size, increase number of processors)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)

## 4. _due 11/19_ Performance evaluation

Include detailed analysis of computation performance, communication performance.

Include figures and explanation of your analysis.
